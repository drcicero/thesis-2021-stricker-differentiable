# For Supervisors

There is a button on github, on the top of the page called "use this template". Use that to create a copy of this repository.
Then, add `[@yourgithubname]` to repository description of the new copy, to make it easier to identify the one responsible for the repository.

# For students

In this version of the template, all class files are included.
However, fonts still have to be installed, see the link in the next section to acquire the fonts.

The main file is `thesis.txt` which should be modified by the student to update the structure, metadata, and includes.
All content files should be in some sub folder, the other files in the main folder must not be modified.
